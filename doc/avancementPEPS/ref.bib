abstract="{For bounded, simply-connected domains, an eigenvalue problem for the
    curl operator with divergence-free eigensolutions is investigated. Two
    different weak formulations are presented and discretized by finite
    elements. \par The first one directly delivers the eigenvalues and
    eigensolutions of the original problem, but its discretization leads to a
    degenerate generalized eigenvalue problem with both matrices being
    non-definite, so that an application of standard solvers is not possible.
    \par The second formulation leads to an eigenvalue problem, whose
    eigenvalues are the square of the eigenvalues of the curl operator and the
    corresponding eigenspaces are invariant subspaces of the original problem.
    The finite element discretization results in a generalized eigenvalue
    problem with Hermitian matrices, the one on the right hand side being
    positive definite. For this approach, spectral convergence, optimal-order
    error estimates and absence of spurious modes are established. \par In the
    case of eigenspaces of dimension larger than 1, the eigensolutions of the
    curl operator cannot be reconstructed from the eigensolutions of the second
    formulation. In this case, one can resort to the first variational method.
    \par Finally, some numerical experiments confirm the theoretical results.}",
